Serialized-Client-Server-Communication
======================================

Distributed Systems - Assignment 3 Question 2:

Question:

Write a Java client application that creates an instance of Couple and instantiates one Person. 
It then sends this serialized instance of Couple to a server. The server adds a second Person to Couple
and returns the value back to the client.  In order to validate your client / server application print 
out the values of Couple before sending it to the server, after the server received it, and when the 
client received the modified value of Couple from the server.
